% To form R stroke plane, absolute horizontal plane is first pitched 
% beta radians about -stp_y axis and then rolled by beta_roll radians 
% about the new x axis.  
% both stroke plane frames are basically the wing-attached frames but
% before applying any wing angular rotations phi_w and theta_w.
% theta_b is chi body angle
% wing pitch rotation does not cause wing-attached axes to rotate.
% left wing-attached frame is obtained by rotating right wing-attached
% frame by 180 degrees about the y axis. Hence additional R2 matrix
% multiplication for left wing
% The body-horizontal frame defined as a body-attached frame parallel to 
% absolute horizontal but rotates with yaw turns. Basically captures 
% heading direction and vertical force on the moth. 
% Earth to body-long frame: yaw (phi_b) -> pitch (theta_b) -> roll (psi_b)
% Stroke-plane to wing frame: yaw (phi_w) -> roll (theta_w)
% Every rotation is performed about the x, y and z axes of the new frame
% after the previous rotation
